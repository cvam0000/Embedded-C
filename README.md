###### Register

- collection of some bits (8 bits in case of 8bit MCUs).
- Either each different bit in a register has some purpose or the register as a  holds a value. 
- Registers works  as connection between a CPU and a Peripheral device (like ADC or TIMER). 
- By changing the value of  the register the CPU is actually instructing the PERIPHERAL to do something or it is configuring it in some way.
- And by reading a register,The CPU can know the state of peripheral or read associated data.
